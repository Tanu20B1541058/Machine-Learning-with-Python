# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is a well-known dataset in the computer vision community, often used as a benchmark for classification algorithms. The dataset consists of grayscale images of hand-drawn digits ranging from zero through nine. Each image is 28 pixels in height and width, resulting in a total of 784 pixels. The pixel values represent the darkness or lightness of each pixel, with higher values indicating darker shades.

This project focuses on building a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. The dataset is provided in two files: train.csv and test.csv. The training set contains 785 columns, where the first column represents the label (digit) associated with each image, and the remaining columns contain the pixel values of the images. Each pixel is identified by its position in a 28x28 matrix.

## Approach
The project employs a classification model to recognize handwritten digits. Specifically, a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is utilized for classification. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are popular for image classification tasks, this project explores the effectiveness of a simple classification algorithm like KNN on the MNIST dataset.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Exploration:** The data files train.csv and test.csv are analyzed to understand the structure of the dataset and visualize sample images.
  
2. **Feature Engineering:** No feature engineering is performed as the dataset already contains pixel values that represent the features.
  
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** The KNN classification model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set to measure its accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.

## Usage
To run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.).
3. Execute the code files in the specified order (data exploration, model training, evaluation, etc.).
4. Analyze the results and evaluate the performance of the KNN classifier on the MNIST dataset.
